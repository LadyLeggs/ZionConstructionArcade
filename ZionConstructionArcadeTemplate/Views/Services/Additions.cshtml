        <h2> House additions</h2>
        <p> House additions are a great way to add value to ones home.  It can change the scary attic to a beautiful play room.  Or add a much needed office space.  Adding additons can be pricey, especially if you arn't familiar with the issues that may arise.  I've been in the trade for over 15 years and have references in all the trades to figure out costs and help realize the cost of the project prior to starting. If planned correctly it is a great way to be able to change your space and make your dreams come true.</p>
